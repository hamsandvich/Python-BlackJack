How to play Blackjack
---------------------

1)  Blackjack starts with players making bets.

2)  Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).

3)  Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 
    10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. 
    The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand

4)  Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.

5)  The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.

6)  Players win when their hand totals higher than dealer’s hand, or they have 21 or less when 
    the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21). The payoff is 1 to 1 (i.e., even money).

7)  Players lose their bet when they bust, or when their hand totals less than the dealer’s hand.

8)  If the player’s and dealer’s hands total the same (known as a tie or push), the player retains his bet.

What Does Split
---------------

If you hold two cards that are the same number in your hand, like two eights or two sixes, you can split 
them apart and play each one like two separate hands instead of one. Once you split your two cards into two 
hands, you’ll place your original bet with one hand and place an equal bet on the second, split hand.


What Does Double Down
----------------------

On your original two cards, you can double your bet before the dealer gives you another card. You place 
another bet equal to the first. Then, the dealer will give you only one card The dealer settles all bets 
at the end of the hand.If you have sevens, you can split a pair, as above, and double down if you want to.

Good Luck!
